General
-------

* in the user guide update link to go-studio.py

* do not build js in paster setup-app: should be done manually before
  publishing egg to pypi

* refactor general layout by removing main tabpanel: Mapfile manager would
  be fullscreen and data manager could be opened in an Ext window

* refactor the data manager as a tree in an Ext window: each datasources
  would be children nodes of datastores nodes

* test if postgis datastore is working when default_datastore_postgis is set
  in *.ini file

* add support for deleting datastores/datasources

* remove admin_password property from *.ini file and ask for it on paster
  setup-app command

* review code found with: grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" studio/
