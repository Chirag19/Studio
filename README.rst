Studio is a management system for Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

Studio provides a web interface to help GIS engineers and admins manage their
GIS, with a focus on web GIS.

In its current state Studio features two modules: *Data Manager* and *Mapfile
Manager*.

Data Manager
    Data Manager allows referencing and managing geographic data.

Mapfile Manager
    Mapfile Manager allows managing `MapServer <http://mapserver.org>`_
    mapfiles. Mapfile Manager provides graphical tools, such as sliders and
    color pickers, for editing styles and symbols. It also provides a tool for
    automatic classification, and allows saving layer as templates for reuse.

Other, transversal features offered by Studio include
authentication/authorization, and internationalization.

Studio is based on modern frameworks and libraries, including, but not limited
to, `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com>`_, `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_,
`OGRGDAL <http://gdal.org>`_, `OpenLayers <http://www.openlayers.org>`_, and
`GeoExt <http://www.geoext.org>`_.
