Releasing Studio
================

* Make sure all unit tests pass::

  $ python setup.py nosetests

  For the tests to pass you have to have the EPSG:27572 projection in /usr/share/proj/epsg.

* Compile localization files::

  $ python setup.py compile_catalog

* Generate go-pylons.py script, and move it to the docs/_static directory::

  $ python util/gen-go-studio.py <VERSION_NUMBER>
  $ mv go-studio.py docs/_static/

* Make sure docs render OK::

  $ cd docs
  $ make html

  There should be no meaningful errors or warnings.

* Change setup.py version to the new version number.

* Change docs/conf.py version to the new version number.

* Make sure PyPI long description renders (requires ``collective.dist``
  installed into your Python)::

  $ python setup.py check --restructuredtext

* Release to PyPI::

  $ python setup.py sdist upload

* Publish new docs on Github::

  Follow the steps described in docs/INSTALL_GH_PAGE first.

  Regenerate docs:

  $ cd docs
  $ make html

  Push new docs to Github:

  $ cd _build/html
  $ git commit -am "update docs to new version"
  $ git push origin gh-pages

* Announce to maillist.

* Announce to Twitter.
